<p>
      Posted on Tue 01 August 2023 in <a href="https://ben-nour.com/category/blog.html">blog</a>
</p>
</header>
<div>
<p>Recently I was curious about the origin of my street name and my search online
led me to the <a href="https://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/">NSW Geographical Names Board</a>,
a government body responsible for the management and administration of
geographic and place names within the state of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>So not quite what I was looking for but I still found this to be a fascinating
data set, which is helpfully avaliable as a <a href="https://proposals.gnb.nsw.gov.au/public/geonames/search">CSV file</a> with all record information from the Geographical Name Register that the Board maintains.</p>
<p>The data set includes an ABORIGINAL NAME field and so I thought it would be
interesting to visualise how many places in NSW are of First
Nations origin vs not.</p>
<h2>How I did it</h2>
<p>I used the ever fantastic <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium</a> package
to visualise this data.</p>
<p>But before I could use Folium I needed a GeoJSON file
so what I did was write a Python script to take this CSV file and turn it in
to a GeoJSON file. You can find the script, which is executed daily (so the data is fresh and of use to anyone else out there), and GeoJSON
file in this <a href="https://github.com/ben-n93/NSW_Geographical_Name_Register_GeoJSON/tree/main">repo</a>.</p>
<h2>Data accuracy</h2>
<p>I want to flag that I can't verify as to how accurate this data is.</p>
<p>The aforementioned ABORIGINAL NAME field is blank for many rows/places that, according to the MEANING or ORIGIN fields, are of First Nations origin.
I contacted the Board and they told me that the ABORIGINAL NAME field was <em>"...a recent edition to the Geographical Names Register (it was only added 2 years ago)."</em>. </p>
<p>So what I've done is also included any places that, according to the MEANING or ORIGIN field, are of First Nations origin. </p>
<p>Again, I can't speak to the accuracy of these fields - you can see my doubt when presented with descriptions like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of metadata about a geographical location (Tilcha Creek) with NSW, Australia that is of First Nations origin." height="311.87" src="https://ben-nour.com/images/tilcha_creek.jpg" width="500"/></p>
<p>However I've included these places anyway.</p>
<p>I've also only included places that have been officially 'assigned' by the Board.</p>
<p>You can read more about the different place designations <a href="https://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/59627/Glossary_of_Designation_Values.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Visualising the data</h2>
<p>Originally I wanted to plot all the named places on a map however the Folium map created was so large
that it crashed my browser. I want to note that this is because of the large number
of places that are <em>not</em> of First Nations origin.</p>
<p>Creating a Folium map with places of First Nations origin was of no issue, size-wise:</p>
<iframe height="500" src="https://ben-nour.com/NSW_geographical_places.html" width="750"></iframe>
<p>While I couldn't use Folium to show the vast number of named places that are not of
First Nations origin you can see it in this bar chart:</p>

<p>If you want to see the Jupyter Notebook I used for this you can check it out
in this Github <a href="https://github.com/ben-n93/First_Nations_places_NSW">repo</a>.</p>
