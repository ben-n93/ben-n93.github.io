Hi there!

I'm a data analyst based in Sydney, Australia.

You can view some of my projects [<span style="color:#00498F;">here</span>](https://ben-nour.com/pages/projects.html).

On my blog I write about all things data, on topics such as [splitting a delimited string into rows in Snowflake](https://ben-nour.com/blog/splitting-a-delimited-string-column-into-rows-using-snowflake.html) or
[applying colour conditional formatting in Tableau](https://ben-nour.com/blog/applying-colour-conditional-formatting-to-individual-table-columns-in-tableau.html).

You can contact me at [<span style="color:#00498F;">hello@ben-nour.com</span>](mailto:hello@ben-nour.com) or via [<span style="color:#00498F;">Twitter</span>](https://twitter.com/benjamin_nour).
