Here are some of the projects I've developed:

#### APIs

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">Archer API</span>](https://www.archerapi.com/) is a REST API based on the adult animated sitcom *Archer*. It provides data about *Archer*'s characters,
episodes and quotes.

    - Built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). You can view the source code on [Github](https://github.com/ben-n93/archer_api).

#### Applications/tools

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">VAST XML Parser</span>](https://github.com/ben-n93/VAST_XML_Parser) - an XML parser that extracts Creative and MediaFile element metadata from Video Ad Serving Template XML tags.

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">file_retirement</span>](https://github.com/ben-n93/file_retirement) - A simple command-line tool for cleaning up old, duplicate files. Intended use is for automation via Crontab, Windows Task Scheduler, etc.


#### Automation/bots

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">Gutenberg Sci-Fi Twitter Bot</span>](https://twitter.com/Gutenberg_SciFi) - a Twitter bot that posts daily recommendations of science fiction books from Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain works.

    - You can read about how I created this project on [my blog](https://ben-nour.com/how-i-created-a-twitter-bot-that-posts-about-science-fiction-books.html#how-i-created-a-twitter-bot-that-posts-about-science-fiction-books).

#### Data analysis

- I have analysed and visualised different data sets, primarily using Juypter Notebooks and the pandas library. Some of my favourite projects include:

    - [<span style="color:#00498F;">Which Sydney LGAs have the lowest and highest unemployment rates?</span>](https://ben-nour.com/which-sydney-lgas-have-the-lowest-and-highest-unemployment-rates.html)
