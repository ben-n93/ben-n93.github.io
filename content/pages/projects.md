Here are some of the projects I've developed:

#### APIs

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">pyspaceweather</span>](https://github.com/ben-n93/pyspaceweather) is a Python wrapper for the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's [Space Weather API](https://sws-data.sws.bom.gov.au/).
    - You can read the wrapper documentation at [ReadTheDocs](https://py-spaceweather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Applications/tools

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">geojson-shave</span>](https://github.com/ben-n93/geojson-shave) - A command-line tool that reduces the size of GeoJSON file by truncuating coordinate values to the specified decimal points and eliminating whitespace.

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">tab-pal</span>](https://github.com/ben-n93/tab-pal) - A command-line application that makes it easier, quicker and prettier to 
create custom colour palettes in Tableau.

#### Automation/bots

- [<span style="color:#00498F;">Gutenberg Sci-Fi Twitter Bot</span>](https://twitter.com/Gutenberg_SciFi) - a Twitter bot that posts daily recommendations of science fiction books from Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain works.

#### Data analysis

- I have analysed and visualised different data sets, primarily using Juypter Notebooks and the pandas library. Some of my favourite projects include:
