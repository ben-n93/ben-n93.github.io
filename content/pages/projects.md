Description: Ben Nour's Python projects, which cover everything from Twitter bots to APIs.

Here are some of the projects I've developed:

#### APIs

- [Archer API](https://www.archerapi.com/) - Archer API is a REST API based on the adult animated sitcom. It provides data about Archer's characters,
episodes and quotes:

    - Built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). You can view the source code on [Github](https://github.com/ben-n93/archer_api).

#### Applications/tools

- [VAST XML Parser](https://github.com/ben-n93/VAST_XML_Parser) - an XML parser that extracts Creative and MediaFile element metadata from Video Ad Serving Template XML tags.

- [CSV to Snowflake](https://github.com/ben-n93/CSV_to_Snowflake) - A command-line tool for uploading CSV data to the Snowflake data warehouse.

- [file_retirement](https://github.com/ben-n93/file_retirement) - A simple command-line tool for cleaning up old, duplicate files. Intended use is for automation via Crontab, Windows Task Scheduler, etc.


#### Automation/bots

- [Gutenberg Sci-Fi Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/Gutenberg_SciFi) - a Twitter bot that posts daily recommendations of science fiction books from Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain works:
