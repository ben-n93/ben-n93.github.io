Here are some of the projects I've developed:

#### Applications/tools

- [VAST XML Parser](https://github.com/ben-n93/VAST_XML_Parser) - an XML parser that extracts Creative and MediaFile element metadata from Video Ad Serving Template XML tags.

- [CSV to Snowflake CLI](https://github.com/ben-n93/CSV_to_Snowflake) - A command-line tool for uploading CSV data to the Snowflake data warehouse.

- [file_retirement CLI](https://github.com/ben-n93/file_retirement) - A simple command-line script for cleaning up old, duplicate files. Intended use is for automation via Crontab, Windows Task Scheduler, etc.


#### Automation/bots

- [Gutenberg Sci-Fi Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/Gutenberg_SciFi) - a Twitter bot that posts daily recommendations of science fiction books from Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain works:

- [The Simpsons - Episode History Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/EH_TheSimpsons) - A Twitter bot that posts every day (when possible) about an episode of The Simpsons that aired that day, however many years ago. Fully automated via Github Actions.

#### Data

- [US horror films visualised](http://ben-nour.com/us_horror_films_locations/) - an interactive choropleth map that visualises which states US-based horror films are mostly set in. You can read on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ben.nour_68691/which-us-states-are-horror-films-mostly-set-in-e8f2d4566b62) about how I approached this project.
