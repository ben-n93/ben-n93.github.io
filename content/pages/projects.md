Description: Ben Nour's Python projects, which cover everything from Twitter bots to APIs.

Here are some of the projects I've developed:

#### APIs

- [Archer API](https://www.archerapi.com/) is a REST API based on the adult animated sitcom *Archer*. It provides data about *Archer*'s characters,
episodes and quotes.

    - Built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). You can view the source code on [Github](https://github.com/ben-n93/archer_api).

#### Applications/tools

- [VAST XML Parser](https://github.com/ben-n93/VAST_XML_Parser) - an XML parser that extracts Creative and MediaFile element metadata from Video Ad Serving Template XML tags.

- [CSV to Snowflake](https://github.com/ben-n93/CSV_to_Snowflake) - A command-line tool for uploading CSV data to the Snowflake data warehouse.

- [file_retirement](https://github.com/ben-n93/file_retirement) - A simple command-line tool for cleaning up old, duplicate files. Intended use is for automation via Crontab, Windows Task Scheduler, etc.


#### Automation/bots

- [Gutenberg Sci-Fi Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/Gutenberg_SciFi) - a Twitter bot that posts daily recommendations of science fiction books from Project Gutenberg's collection of public domain works.

    - You can read about how I created this project on [my blog](https://ben-nour.com/how-i-created-a-twitter-bot-that-posts-about-science-fiction-books.html#how-i-created-a-twitter-bot-that-posts-about-science-fiction-books).

#### Data analysis

- I have analysed and visualised different data sets, primarily using Juypter Notebooks and the pandas library. Some of my favourite projects include:

    - [Which Sydney LGAs have the lowest and highest unemployment rates?](https://ben-nour.com/which-sydney-lgas-have-the-lowest-and-highest-unemployment-rates.html)
    - [Using Spotify's API to analyse my Favourite Rock playlist](https://ben-nour.com/using-spotifys-api-to-analyse-my-favourite-rock-playlist.html)
    - [Where are Australia's oil and gas pipelines located?](https://ben-nour.com/where-are-australias-oil-and-gas-pipelines-located.html)

#### Misc

- [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@ben.nour_68691) - On Medium I write about all things data, from [applying colour conditional formatting in Tableau](https://medium.com/@ben.nour_68691/applying-colour-conditional-formatting-to-individual-table-columns-in-tableau-23e6e82d8251) to 
[splitting delimited strings in Snowflake](https://medium.com/@ben.nour_68691/splitting-a-delimited-string-column-into-rows-using-snowflake-84930d257910).
